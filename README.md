# Advent of Code 2020

I am working the Advent of Code 2020 in Java for my own learning.
Each day will be its own package and tests will allow both the examples and actual answers to be available.
To run, make sure you have maven and java (at least java 8) installed and run the following command:
```sh
mvn clean test
```

I will be blogging each day (after some time) at [my blog](https://ddellspe.net) so feel free to subscribe/follow for your own fun.
